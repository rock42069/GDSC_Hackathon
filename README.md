# GDSC_Hackathon
I participated in a two level hackathon and secured 4th position over all. The hackathon was based on Generative AI.


## Hackathon 1 
Design a conditional generative model to generate stylised english alphabets (A-Z)

I implemented DCGAN using PyTorch library all the code with all explanation for each parameter is upload in the repo

## Hackathon 2

Problem Statement: 
Design a conditional generative model to generate stylised english alphabets (A-Z)
where we control which alphabet (eg. R) we want to generate, and style is chosen randomly.

I implemented cDCGAN using PyTorch library all the code with all explanation for each parameter is upload in the repo
